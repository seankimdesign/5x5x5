#### Portfolio Management CMS using Node.js, Express and Dust.js

This is an academic project to engage the flexibility of Node.js platform. Frameworks such as Angular and React were intentionally avoided to fully leverage the Node.js and Express API, SPA (single-page-application) behavior was implemented by manually building DOM with Dust.js templating engine doing the heavy lifting.

The front-end solution has been created using pure javascript without any reliance on jQuery - another academic effort.
