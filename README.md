#### Portfolio Management CMS using Node.js, Express, MongoDB and and Dust.js

This is an academic project to examine the Node.js platform.

Frameworks such as Angular and React were intentionally avoided to fully explore the Node.js / Express environment while leveraging the expressiveness of Dust.js templating engine. SPA (single-page-application) behavior was entirely written by hand, with each 'page' request culminating in partial view renders and DOM rebuilding.

The front-end solution was also written in pure javascript without any reliance on jQuery or other library: another academic effort.
